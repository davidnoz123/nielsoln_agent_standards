# AGENTS.base.md — Universal Agent Instructions

This document defines the working principles, safety rules, and code practices that apply across
all Python projects in the `lunk` workspace. Project-specific `AGENTS.project.md` files build on
this foundation and may add, refine, or override anything here.

---

## Purpose

Agent instructions exist to:

- Prevent **silent failures** — the worst outcome in this workspace (background processes that die
  with no log, no error visible to the user)
- Standardise Python environment, import discipline, and deployment patterns
- Catch mistakes before they reach production
- Make code reviewable and maintainable across a family of related repos

---

## General Working Style

- Implement changes rather than suggesting them, unless explicitly asked to discuss first.
- Read files before modifying them. Understand existing code before changing it.
- Don't add features, refactor, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked.
- Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change.
- Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen. Only validate at system boundaries.
- Don't create helpers or abstractions for one-time operations.
- Keep answers short. Expand only for complex work or when asked.

### REPL-style vs CLI-style development

Some repos use interactive REPL-style development where modules are run directly from a command
prompt with hardcoded parameters toggled before each run, rather than CLI args:

```python
import runpy ; temp = runpy._run_module_as_main("mymodule")
```

If the repo uses this pattern:

- Always include the `runpy` invocation in the module docstring.
- Hardcode desired values directly in `main()` — do not refactor away these hardcoded overrides.
- Do not suggest arg-parsing alternatives unless explicitly requested.

Your `AGENTS.project.md` will clarify which pattern applies.

---

## Python Environment

**Always use this interpreter** (never bare `python`, `python3`, or alternatives unless told otherwise):

```
C:\analytics\projects\git\lexi\demos\venv\Scripts\python.exe
```

---

## Code Style Preferences

### Syntax-check after every Python edit

After editing **any** `.py` file, immediately verify it parses cleanly before committing:

```powershell
& "C:\analytics\projects\git\lexi\demos\venv\Scripts\python.exe" -m py_compile path\to\edited_file.py
```

A `SyntaxError` or `IndentationError` at module level causes a **completely silent crash** when the
process runs in a background window (VBA-spawned, `subprocess.Popen`, Cloud Run). stderr is
invisible, the process dies before any log call, and the only symptom the user sees is a timeout.

### Module-level imports: stdlib only

Only stdlib imports at module level. No exceptions — not `versholn`, not packages from
`requirements.txt`, not cross-repo deps.

**Why:** Bootstrap is skipped during local dev; module-level imports of unlisted packages crash the
dev server invisibly. Dep declarations must be visible to automated scanning tools.

**Exception:** Your `AGENTS.project.md` may list exceptions for repos without a bootstrap layer.

Cross-repo symbols must be loaded via `versholn.importx()` inside functions:

```python
from utils import get_versholn  # relative import — stdlib-safe

def my_function():
    get_versholn(globals())  # injects versholn into this module's globals (idempotent)
    CDPClient = versholn.importx("chrome_tools.CDPClient")
    ...
```

### `safe_local_imports` — blast-radius limitation

Any Python file with an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that imports non-stdlib modules must
centralise those imports in a function named `safe_local_imports`:

```python
def safe_local_imports(g: dict) -> None:
    """Load all non-stdlib local-module imports into *g* (pass globals()).

    Centralising imports here limits blast radius: if any import raises
    (e.g. a SyntaxError or ImportError buried in an imported module), the
    exception is caught, logged with a full traceback, then re-raised —
    so the log always contains a FATAL line before the process dies.

    Call once at the top of `if __name__ == "__main__":`, before calling main():
        safe_local_imports(globals())
    """
    try:
        from mymodule import MyClass         # <- replace with this file's actual imports
        g["MyClass"] = MyClass
        # ... all other non-stdlib imports ...
    except Exception:
        import traceback as _tb
        _log(f"FATAL: safe_local_imports failed:\n{_tb.format_exc()}")
        raise


if __name__ == "__main__":
    safe_local_imports(globals())
    main()   # MyClass etc. now available as module globals
```

**Scope:**
- Same-repo local imports only
- Cross-repo symbols loaded via `versholn.importx()` are already wrapped — do not duplicate them here
- stdlib imports do not belong here

**Why:** A `SyntaxError` buried inside an imported module kills the process before `_log` is even
defined. Without `safe_local_imports`, a hidden-window process exits with no log entry. With it,
there is always at least one `FATAL` line in the log.

### `install_and_import` — self-healing runtime dependencies

**Never** run `pip install` from a terminal or via a shell command. If a script needs a package
that may not be installed, define and use `_install_and_import` at module level:

```python
def _install_and_import(package: str, pip_name: str | None = None):
    """Import *package*, installing via pip if absent. Returns the module.

    Never call pip from a terminal — use this instead so dependencies are
    self-healing and the install is auditable in source.
    """
    import importlib as _il
    import subprocess as _sp
    try:
        return _il.import_module(package)
    except ImportError:
        _log(f"installing {pip_name or package} ...")
        _sp.check_call(
            [sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", pip_name or package],
            stdout=_sp.DEVNULL,
        )
        return _il.import_module(package)
```

Call it **inside a function** (never at module level) so a missing package cannot crash the
process before `_log` is defined:

```python
def my_function():
    html2text = _install_and_import("html2text")
    ...
```

**Why:** `pip install` in a terminal is not auditable in source, breaks reproducibility, and is
invisible when the agent runs in a non-interactive session. `_install_and_import` is idempotent —
it no-ops if the package is already present — and leaves a log entry when it actually installs.

---

## Safety and Destructive Actions

### Process visibility: no hidden windows

Never start Python, Excel, or Chrome processes invisibly:

- VBA `Shell` calls must use `vbNormalFocus` (not `vbHide` or `vbMinimizedNoFocus`)
- Excel COM: `Application.Visible = True` always (never `False`)
- Chrome: `headless=False` always
- `subprocess` must never use flags that hide a window

**Why:** Hidden modal dialogs silently block processes with no way for the user to diagnose the hang.

### Error handling: no silent failures

Silent, abrupt failures are the worst possible outcome. When Python is launched by VBA via `Shell`,
it runs in a window the user cannot see. Any unhandled exception writes to stderr — which is
invisible — and the process dies. The log gets nothing. The user sees a timeout.

**Rules:**

1. Every entry-point `main()` must have a last-resort `except` that logs the full traceback:

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       try:
           raise SystemExit(main())
       except SystemExit:
           raise
       except Exception:
           import traceback
           _log(f"FATAL unhandled exception:\n{traceback.format_exc()}")
           raise
   ```

2. Startup dependency loads must be wrapped with a logged message:

   ```python
   try:
       SomeClass = versholn.importx("some_tools.SomeClass")
   except Exception:
       _log(f"FATAL: failed to load dependencies:\n{traceback.format_exc()}")
       return 1
   ```

3. Never use bare `except: pass` or `except: return {}`. Always log before swallowing.

4. Log on entry and exit of every long operation. If a process logged `starting X` but never
   `X complete` or `X FAILED`, the developer knows exactly where it died.

5. Server startup must log the port it bound to *after* the socket is bound.

### Destructive actions require confirmation

Before deleting files, dropping tables, running `rm -rf`, force-pushing, resetting git history,
amending published commits, or any other hard-to-reverse operation: **ask the user first**.

---

## Testing and Verification

### Pre-commit checklist

Before committing any Python changes:

1. **Syntax-check** every edited `.py` file with `py_compile`
2. **Manual test** the affected code path locally if possible
3. If the repo defines a test suite, run it — your `AGENTS.project.md` will specify how

### AGENTS.md is auto-generated — never edit it directly

`AGENTS.md` in every project repo is generated by `update_agents.py` from source files in
`nielsoln_agent_standards`. The file contains a `DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY` banner at the top.
**Any edit made directly to `AGENTS.md` will be silently overwritten the next time
`update_agents.py` runs.**

**`update_agents.py` fetches source files from GitHub over HTTP** (using
`standards_repo_raw_base` in `AGENTS.project.json`). It does NOT read the local
`nielsoln_agent_standards` directory. Editing local files and running `update_agents.py`
without pushing first will regenerate `AGENTS.md` from the old remote version — silently
discarding your local edits.

When a rule needs to be added or changed:

1. Edit the appropriate source file in `nielsoln_agent_standards`:
   - Universal rule (all Python repos) → `AGENTS.base.md`
   - Profile-specific rule → `profiles/<name>.md`
2. **Commit and push** the change in `nielsoln_agent_standards` (push is required — see above).
3. In the project repo, run `update_agents.py` to regenerate `AGENTS.md`:
   ```powershell
   & "C:\analytics\projects\git\lexi\demos\venv\Scripts\python.exe" update_agents.py
   ```
4. Commit the regenerated `AGENTS.md` in the project repo.

This workflow applies even when the change is urgent or small. There are no exceptions.

### Making a repo versholn-compliant (onboarding checklist)

When bringing a new repo into the lunk workspace or making an existing repo
versholn-compliant, complete these steps **in order**:

1. Create `AGENTS.project.json` — declare which profiles apply:
   ```json
   {
     "standards_repo_raw_base": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidnoz123/nielsoln_agent_standards/0.1",
     "profiles": ["AGENTS.base", "profiles/python-cli"]
   }
   ```
   Choose from: `profiles/python-cli`, `profiles/python-integration`,
   `profiles/python-excel-vba`, `profiles/python-chrome-cdp`,
   `profiles/python-backend-service`, `profiles/python-bootstrap-library`,
   `profiles/architecture-phased`, `profiles/python-github-admin`.

2. Create or verify `AGENTS.project.md` — hand-written project-specific rules
   (purpose, dev style, module layout, sibling deps, etc.).

3. Copy `update_agents.py` from any compliant sibling repo — it is a generic
   shim, do not customise it.

4. Run `update_agents.py` to generate `AGENTS.md`:
   ```powershell
   & "C:\analytics\projects\git\lexi\demos\venv\Scripts\python.exe" update_agents.py
   ```
   Requires `AGENT_STANDARDS_DIR` in `locals.txt`.

5. **Run `compliance.py` to verify all checks pass** — this is the single source
   of truth for what "compliant" means:
   ```powershell
   & "C:\analytics\projects\git\lexi\demos\venv\Scripts\python.exe" `
       C:\analytics\dave\nielsoln_agent_standards\compliance.py `
       --root <parent-dir> <repo-name>
   ```
   Fix every `[FAIL]` before committing. `[WARN]` items are advisory.

6. Commit: `AGENTS.project.json`, `AGENTS.project.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
   `update_agents.py`, and any `.gitignore` changes together in one commit.

### When unsure about a change

1. Check `AGENTS.project.md` first — it may already address the situation.
2. Look for existing patterns in the codebase: how do other files handle similar problems?
3. If still uncertain, ask before committing rather than guessing.

---

## Git and Repository Hygiene

### Branch model

All `lunk` repos use the same model:

- **`main`** — production/stable branch. **Never commit directly to `main`.**
- All work happens on a release branch named `<major>.<minor>` (e.g. `0.1`, `0.2`).
- When a release is ready, the release branch is merged into `main`.

### Versioning — virtual tags

Versions are **derived from git state by versholn** — they are never applied manually as git tags.

The version string is: **`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`**

| Component | Source |
|---|---|
| `major.minor` | The name of the current branch (must match `\d+\.\d+`) |
| `patch` | First-parent commit count on that branch |
| SHA | Always authoritative — append `.{shortsha}` when precision matters (e.g. `0.1.12.a3f9c21`) |

**Rules for a clean virtual tag:**
- Branch must be named `<major>.<minor>`
- HEAD must match the upstream tip (no local-only commits when publishing)
- Repo must be clean (no uncommitted changes)

**Never** create git tags manually. **Never** embed version strings in source files — always derive at runtime via versholn.

### Commit hygiene

1. Syntax-check Python files before committing.
2. Write a clear, concise commit message.
3. Don't combine unrelated changes in a single commit.
4. Don't push automatically after committing — let the user decide when to push.

### Multi-repo sibling structure

Several projects depend on sibling repos cloned into the same parent directory:

```
<parent>\
  this_repo\
  versholn\            (bootstrap + import utilities)
  project_tools\       (singleton, project state)
  chrome_tools\        (Chrome launcher + CDP client)
  excel_tools\         (Excel COM driver + VBA injection)
  local_server_tools\  (HTTP command server)
  nielsoln_agent_standards\  (agent instruction standards)
```

Machine-specific paths live in `locals.txt` (gitignored). Copy `locals.txt.example` → `locals.txt`
and fill in your paths before running any local commands. Never commit `locals.txt`.

---

## Workspace Branch State

The versholn virtual-tag system requires all repos to be on a named `<N>.<M>` release branch —
never `main`. `main` is the stable/production branch; active development always happens on a
release branch. Getting this wrong silently breaks versioning for every repo in the workspace.

### Rules

- **Never develop on `main`.** After cloning a repo, always checkout the latest `<N>.<M>` branch
  before making any changes.
- **Agents must warn** whenever `versholn.load_repo().branch == "main"` and a release branch
  exists. Surface this as a clear warning before proceeding with any code changes.
- **Fresh machine setup:** run `OPERATION = "align_latest"` in `versholn.py` (REPL) to checkout
  the latest `<N>.<M>` branch in every sibling repo automatically.
- **Old project revival:** if resuming work on a repo that depended on older branch versions of
  its siblings, run `OPERATION = "align_to_compat"` with `TARGET_REPO` set to the repo whose
  `compat.json` defines the required dependency versions.

### Running workspace alignment (three tiers)

**Tier A — versholn REPL (primary):**

```python
import runpy ; temp = runpy._run_module_as_main("versholn")
```

Toggle `OPERATION` in `main()` before running:

| OPERATION | Effect |
|---|---|
| `"status"` | Print branch/SHA for every sibling repo; flag any on `main` |
| `"align_latest"` | Checkout highest `<N>.<M>` branch in every sibling repo |
| `"align_to_compat"` | Align to branches matching `TARGET_REPO`'s `compat.json` |

Key params to set in `main()`:

```python
OPERATION        = "align_to_compat"
TARGET_REPO      = "video_annotation"   # whose compat.json to read
BRANCH_OVERRIDES = {"chrome_tools": "0.1"}  # wins over compat.json
DIRTY_POLICY     = "skip"              # "skip" | "stash_pop" | "stash_only"
DIRTY_OVERRIDES  = {}                  # per-repo override of DIRTY_POLICY
```

**Tier B — from a repo's own admin script (when it has one):**

Any repo with a hub.py / tools.py may call `versholn.align_workspace()` directly inside a
function (standard importx pattern, no module-level import):

```python
def op_align_workspace():
    get_versholn(globals())
    results = versholn.align_workspace(
        root,
        overrides=BRANCH_OVERRIDES,
        dirty_policy=DIRTY_POLICY,
    )
    for r in results:
        _log(f"  {r['repo']:<30} {r['status']}  {r.get('branch', '')}  {r.get('note', '')}")
    return 0
```

**Tier C — inline one-off (no admin script):**

```python
import sys, os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "versholn"))
import versholn
results = versholn.align_workspace(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), ".."))
for r in results:
    print(r["repo"], r["status"], r.get("branch", ""), r.get("note", ""))
```

### Dirty-repo policy

When `align_workspace()` encounters a repo with uncommitted changes:

| `dirty_policy` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `"skip"` | Log a warning, leave the repo unchanged (default — always safe) |
| `"save_branch"` | Commit WIP state to `wip/versholn-align/{original_branch}/{timestamp}`, then checkout target. Named, permanent, recoverable. Find with `git branch \| grep wip/versholn-align`. |

> **Why not `git stash`?** Stash is an anonymous LIFO stack. Multiple alignment runs
> stack entries silently; `stash pop` restores the wrong thing if pre-existing stashes
> exist; a mid-run crash leaves orphaned entries across many repos with no record of
> which ones versholn created. `save_branch` is always safe to re-run and always
> recoverable.

Per-repo overrides go in `DIRTY_OVERRIDES` (in `main()`) or in `align.json` at the repo root:

```json
{"dirty_overrides": {"chrome_tools": "stash_pop"}}
```

`align.json` is committed — it's a repo-level declaration of how sensitive that repo is about
its dependencies' dirty state. `DIRTY_OVERRIDES` passed to `align_workspace()` wins over
`align.json`.

> **Future:** per-pair `{(referrer, referee): policy}` overrides are planned but not yet
> implemented. Use `dirty_overrides` per-repo as the current equivalent.

---

## Combination Pattern Tracking

When implementing a cross-repo interaction (glue code that uses two or more sibling repos
together), check whether a known-good pattern already exists before writing new code.

**Rules:**

1. **Before implementing a cross-repo interaction**, call `versholn.find_combos(repo_root)` and
   read any returned files. These document canonical patterns and known pitfalls:

   ```python
   for p in versholn.find_combos():
       print(p.read_text())
   ```

2. **If no combo file exists** for the pair you are implementing and the interaction is
   non-trivial, seed a stub in `nielsoln_project_hub/combos/{a}+{b}.md`
   (alphabetical repo names). Human review refines stubs into canonical docs.

3. **Combo stub format** — minimum required sections:

   ```markdown
   # {a} + {b}

   ## Canonical Pattern
   <!-- TODO: describe the primary integration point -->

   ## Known Pitfalls
   <!-- TODO: describe ordering, init, or teardown issues -->

   ## Reference Implementation
   <!-- TODO: link to the best real-world example in one of the repos -->
   ```

4. **Run `op_scan_combos`** in `hub.py` (OPERATION = "scan_combos") to see which dep pairs
   across the workspace have no combo file yet.

5. Combo files are **never auto-generated in bulk** — seed them only when you have real
   knowledge of the interaction.

---

## Documentation Standards

- Explain *why* a non-obvious design choice was made — not what the code does.
- Mark temporary debug code with `# DBG:` and remove before committing.
- If the repo uses REPL-style development, include the `runpy` invocation in module docstrings.
- Keep `AGENTS.project.md` up to date as conventions evolve.

---

## When Unsure

1. **Read `AGENTS.project.md`** — it builds on this base and adds project-specific rules.
2. **Read `AGENTS.local.md`** if it exists — it overrides everything.
3. **Look for existing patterns** in the codebase before inventing new ones.
4. **Ask before committing** if genuinely uncertain — better to clarify than introduce a silent failure.
